# Learn To Build React

It took me a while to watch [Build react from scratch](https://github.com/zpao/building-react-from-scratch) and that was the most ideas came from. **To make it more understandable, this repo try to give more add-ons on how react works step by steps.**

## Blogs
* [Doc1 - What happened in App.js](blogs/what-happened-in-App-js.md)
* [Doc2 - How mountComponent() Work](blogs/how-mountComponent-work.md)
* [Doc3 - How mountComponent() Work - Contd](blogs/how-mountComponent-work-contd.md)
* [Doc4 - Update](blogs/update.md)
* [Doc5 - Update - Contd](blogs/update-ctd.md)

## What I'm Doing
Though with those tutorials, blogs and friendly comments, I still met a lot of troubles with codes and always try to figure out what these means. These are source codes afterall ^.^
So here I would like to write some add-ons, mainly focus on showing the work flow and try to explain how react actually works step by step. I would try to explain some complex parts of codes as well as what problems I habe met and how I figured out them. It would be great if these help you better perceive these codes.

## Run It

Note: it would be a great helps to successfully build and run this demo before go into the actual codes. You might wanna use `console.log` to print out the results.

* In dilithium
```sh
> cd ./dilithium
> npm install
> npm run build
```
* In demo
```sh
> cd ./demo
> npm install
> npm run build
```

## Disclaimers
Most of the codes is originally written by [@zpao](https://github.com/zpao) in [Build react from scratch](https://github.com/zpao/building-react-from-scratch). There have been existing summarizable and detailed tutorials - [Learn-React-Source-Code](https://dragonforker.github.io/learn-react-source-code/) written by [@Chang](https://github.com/cyan33/).
